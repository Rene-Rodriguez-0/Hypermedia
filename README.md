## User Profile
The user profile of this website is for people who want to showcase their resume in an intuitive and easy to update platform.
## Project analysis
It has 2 main containers the “header” and the “main-container”:
 - The header has the picture, the name and two buttons to change the language.
 - The “main-container” has two horizontal sub-containers, “lateral” and “content”:
   - “lateral” shows the contact and projects sections.
   - “content” shows about me, education, work experience, skills and languages.
## Visual design
The visual design follows a dark brown color scheme (#2b0000 and #400000) reinforcing the professionalism of the profile. The background of the main content is white, which creates a clear contrast with the sidebar and header. The profile image in circular format gives it a personal and modern touch. The sidebar each contact link and project is accompanied by icons. The content sections are detachable so you can see in detail the information without feeling overwhelmed.
